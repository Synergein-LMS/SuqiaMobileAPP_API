Despite 2.6 billion people gaining access to improved drinking water sources since 1990, there are still 663 million people without access to clean water. At Suqia, we believe investing in our future generation is one approach to tackle this. By educating and empowering our youth, we embed the values of giving for future generations.",
            "content_2":"Water is a basic human right and a driver for sustainable growth and development. It is important that our future generations are aware that water is critically linked with food security, agriculture, education, climate and gender equality. People cannot develop and prosper if they are forced to spend hours each day to find and transport clean water, lack of clean water and sanitation lock people in a cycle of poverty. It is important to us to build a generation that is aware of the value of water and how it drives people forward."
