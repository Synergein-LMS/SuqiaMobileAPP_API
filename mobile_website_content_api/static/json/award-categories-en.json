The project can consist of a single system or a pool of multiple systems that have been deployed by the same organisation in different locations. The project should rely on 100% use of renewable energy to produce safe drinking water in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. It should demonstrate innovation in production capacity, overcoming technical limitations, disinfection systems, operation and maintenance requirements, while also improving efficiency and cost effectiveness. The project benefits should meet the WHO requirements for non-emergency water availability, that is, provide a minimum of 30 lit/person/day* to intended recipients.",
